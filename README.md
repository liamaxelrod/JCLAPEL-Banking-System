# JC LAPEL Banking System

Group 7's project for DIT094

## TODO
- List simple tasks for the repository here, not specific work tasks

# SSH Help
- (For MacOS users) If you are having trouble with the passphrased SSH((i.e. unable to connect to the repository), you should try using `ssh-add` at least once because you need the SSH Agent.
	- Additionally, for specific keys, refer to the directory of `~/.ssh/key_file_name_here` and the extra parameter of `--apple-use-keychain`.
